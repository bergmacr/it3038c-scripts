1. Open up a PowerShell ISE window (I find it much faster to use the GUI.)

2. Click File\Open\(path to the freespace.ps1 file you downloaded from github)

3. The file will open up and the script will be loaded into the top pane.

4. Go ahead and click the green run button in the top menu bar.

5. A GridView window should open up containing some information about your C: drive including the size, freespace, and % of freespace available in GB.
	(This information is also put into a table inside of your PowerShell window.)
